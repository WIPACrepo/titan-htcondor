* It would be good to have main script to check if everything is working
    and to self-destruct otherwise. Right now, job will continue to run
    if these occur (they haven't so far):
        - pool-shutdown-agent.sh dies
        - CM container dies
        - many workers die
        - jobs not scheduled
        - jobs failing en-masse
* CM is not running a worker, which wastes a GPU, because I am worried
    the job may cause CM failure, e.g. if the job runs out of memory,
    killing CM's aprun. Likelihood of this happening is very low (never
    happened), but the cost could be very high, especially since currently
    I don't check CM's health in the main script.
* aprun does not need to transfer executable (-b)
* aprun should probably "attempt to reconnect around failed nodes" (-C)
* if an aprun fails, it should probably restart (-R) (can't use -C then).
