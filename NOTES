* memory hold doesn't seem to work
* auto-shutdown before jobs runs out of time doesn't seem to work
* titan-condor-pool.pbs uses hard-coded paths to, e.g. pool directory
	which is bad if we want to run multiple pools in parallel
* no way to resume pools without editing driver.sh to not submit jobs
* copy job submission file to pool dir? (might be wrong level of abstraction)
