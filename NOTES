* need to improve shutdown: workers first, then cm, then pbs
* memory hold doesn't seem to work
* auto-shutdown before jobs runs out of time doesn't seem to work
* titan-condor-pool.pbs uses hard-coded paths to, e.g. pool directory
	which is bad if we want to run multiple pools in parallel
* no way to resume pools without editing driver.sh to not submit jobs
* copy job submission file to pool dir? (might be wrong level of abstraction)
* I suspect that some jobs ran multiple times because schedd wasn't shutdown
	cleanly when job killed on out-of-time
* events log still rotating
* enable cgroups (if titan can do it) in condor for better catching of
    jobs that go over memory?
* history log still rotating
* keeps trying to send email to condor devs Can't send UPDATE_COLLECTOR_AD to collector
* when a pool is resumed with the same worker as previous time, condor may think
    that worker is still running previous job?
